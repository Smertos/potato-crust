# Potato Crust

Honestly, don't expect anything to work. I rarely update this project, and I'm not even sure if it's even functional at
times.

This project is my attempt to create a mini-Minecraft clone and learn Bevy along the way.

# Goals

* chunk-based world
* some basic interaction with the world (like breaking/placing blocks)
* maybe a bit of world generation
* how about some TNT going boom-boom? (could use it to test world interaction performance)
* physics based character controller (simple vert pill collider with camera attached, no player models)
* if it comes to it, inventory system wouldn't hurt

not planing on integrating with MC's assets or data formats, but might reconsider way later.
