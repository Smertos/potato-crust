# Potato Crust

This project is my attempt to create a Minecraft clone and learn Bevy along the way.

# Goals

For now, this project is purely self-educational one, so I'm trying to avoid scope creep by limiting my plans.

### Rendering

* Rendering worlds pre-generated in Minecraft
* Render player's hand in first person view
* Render players & entities

### Gameplay

* Breaking and placing blocks
* Inventory system
* Hotbar
* Use Minecraft's assets to provide all the blocks & whistles

### Unique stuff
* Auto-download assets from some fixed version

### Multiplayer

I'm not sure if I'm going to tackle this.
My current initial plan is only doing singleplayer implementation.

### Anything else?
No, but I might extend this list in the future if anything comes to mind or if most of the features above get implemented.
